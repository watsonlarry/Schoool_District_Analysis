# School District Testing Analysis

## Overview

After preforming an analysis of standardized test scores and funding data for a school district (wish I could be more specific), the work is invalidated by evidence of academic chicanery. The reading and math scores for Thomas High School 9th graders seem to have been edited post-examination. To remedy this complication, we'll remove the Thomas High School 9th graders' test scores from the data and re-perform the analysis.

  Changes in the district summary after removing the compromised data are minimal. The overall passing percentage for students is only lowered by .3%. Not a surprise when only 460 students are removed from a data set of nearly 40,000 students.
